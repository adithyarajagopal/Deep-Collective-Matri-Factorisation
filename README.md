# Deep-Collective-MatriX-Factorisation
This is a part of my internship at National University of Singaore as a deep learning intern
I was asked to implement a paper on Deep Collective Matrix Factorisation for producing embeddings of heterogeneos graphs and was asked to make improvements to the model using Matrix factorisation techniques
Further this was followed by incorporation of node heterogeneity

A heterogeneous graph is a graph with multile types of nodes and link weights
Some datasets are better represented using heterogeneous graphs, like a drug disease network, a social network etc

So this models aims to rojject nodes into a lower dimensional space, a vector representation so that each vector representation of every node can be used for tasks like link prediction and node classification 

I have performed both the above tasks, improved the performance of the existing model, incorporated node heterogeneity ie capturing information from different node types and compared with a baseline model
